There’s nothing else that could describe it better.\n\nLevel 99 is the 100th level of the Backrooms.\n\n\n\nA photograph of Level 99. The reason for distortion is unknown.\n\n\nDescription:\nAs previously stated, Level 99 is sickeningly orange, and even more so distorted. Though the photo does not capture it very well. The level, in a physical sense, is normal; the sand isn’t soft and the skies aren’t solid. The level resembles a red, sanded desert with no day/night cycle. The sky is always orange and doesn’t seem to change at all. The sand of Level 99 looks almost identical to the red sand from the Frontrooms, if not for the sand in Level 99 being entirely comprised of oxidized metals. The sand has a distinct metallic scent and is usually comprised of copper and iron with the occasional unidentifiable ores.\n\n\nRecordedLog\n\nHideLog\n\n\nRecorded Log\n\nstart log.\nArthur: Testing, testing.\nStanley: I think it’s working!\nArthur: No shit captaiin obvious.\nArthur: Damnit the system keeps doubling the I’s when I say captaiin.\n\nStanley: Oh well, never mind that, aren’t we going to enter the level?\n\nArthur: Calm your ass onion boy, and get the gas masks.\n\nStanley: Gas masks? Why would we need those?\n[Arthur sighs in disappointment]\nArthur: Sweet christ, the sky is fucking orange.\nArthur: We don’t need an oxygen test to know that isn’t breathable.\nStanley: Good point.\nend log.\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscovery:\nStanley and I had been eating lunch, just taking a walk around Level 4, when we ran into a door suspended about thirty centimeters above the ground. I’m sure it was spruce, but that doesn’t matter, though there is a sign nailed to the door with “Ghoul Town” written on it. We radioed the higher ups about it, and since had we brought our supplies with us incase of an emergency, they asked us to go take a look. Opening the door leads into Level 99, or “Ghoul Town”. There is a strange phenomenon that happens with this door too, and this is some pretty trippy shit. Because there’s no door frame, if you went behind it while it was open, the door would disappear. And if you go behind it while it’s closed, then what would you expect, you’d get the other side of the door.\n\nRecordedLog2\n\nHideLog\n\n\nRecorded Log 2\n\nstart log.\nArthur: Alright. So I’m about roughly two kilometers in, I asked Stanley to stay by the door to see if it does a disappearing act on us.\n…\nArthur: So he radioed me about five minutes ago saying it’s stayed the same, and doesn’t lock when you close it. So now I have to wait for him to get here. Sigh, at least this tumbleweed is here to-\nTumbleweed: Hey, I have a name man, not cool. My mom didn’t name me for people like you to not use it. Jeez.\nArthur: … Ah, I’m going insane. Well, mister Humbleweed, what’s your name?\nJoseph: It’s Joseph, and for your information. You’re not going insane, yet, no. I’m just a sentient dried up bush. Also, how’d you know my last name was Humbleweed? Are you a cop or something, cause I swear I haven’t been drinking.\nArthur: Well Joseph. This was a nice reality check. Thanks.\nJoseph: Hey no problem man, although you might be a cop, I still got some respect for ya. Though I must be going now, cause I’ve got some very important business with a certain cactus. It’s a date, you see!\nArthur: Well, aren’t you the lucky guy. And I should also be going soon because this fever dream is getting a little too trippy for my taste.\n[Arthur stands up and places a spare recorder into the sentient tumbleweed]\nArthur: Hey, one last question before you go?\nJoseph: Hmm? Yeah sure, ask away!\nArthur: Can you… feel that?\nJoseph: You mean the breeze of the afternoon breeze? Yeah, I do! Speaking of which, I gotta go now! My ride is here. See you again sometime, Arthur!\nArthur: Yeah, you to- Wait. When the fuck did I tell you my name?\nJoseph: Just a lucky guessssssssssss-\n[Joseph the Tumbleweed continues saying “sss“ as he is taken into the distance by a strong breeze]\nStanley: Huff, huff. Oh man! I really needed the exercise! Huff. Hope I haven’t made you wait too long?\nArthur: Wait… if you’re here… then that means I haven’t woken up yet, which in turn means I wasn’t dreaming… THAT WAS FUCKING REAL?\nStanley: Huh? Dude, what are you going on about?\n[Arthur rests his arm on Stanley’s shoulder]\nArthur: Between you and me Stan. Joseph never existed. Alright?\nStanley: But who-\nArthur: Shhhh. Just don’t tell Nick alright?\nStanley: uh… Okay?\n[Arthur gives Stanley a hard pat on the back]\nArthur: Fantastic! Now, where we’re we headed? Oh right!\nend log.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunities:\nGhoul Town:\nWe haven’t reached it yet, but we do know it probably exists. We’re roughly five kilometers in now, too late to turn back. But we did tie a rope to the doorknob before we left, it was a real long rope the M.E.G. had found and cut off at around 15 kilometers long and 10 centimeters thick, it was basically super strength yarn. And it was a bitch and a half to fit into our supplies, especially because Butter Fingers Nicky dropped the thing and it unraveled. Though, when we eventually reach the town, the rope might be a useful pathfinder.\n\nRecordedLog3\n\nHideBox\n\n\nRecorded Log 3\n\nstart log.\n[Abrupt shuffling]\nArthur: FUCK THIS. HOW LONG HAVE WE BEEN WALKING FOR??\nStanley: Woah Arthur- you need to calm down man.\nArthur: Calm down? Calm down?? We’ve been walking for a few hours but it feels like an eternity. How the fuck do we know this place even exists? I can’t even tell what shade of orange is the ground, the sky, or your curly ass hair.\nStanley: Please just try and calm down- here look. I’ll call back to the M.E.G. and call for backup.\nArthur: Oh that’s going to be very helpful! They can find our bodies and attend our funeral out here.\n[Stanley sighs loudly followed by radio buzz]\nM.E.G. Operative: Hello? Agents… Stanley and Arthur?\nStanley: Yes that’s us- Listen, we’re in need of backup. The exploration of “Ghoul Town” is much more… intensive- than we expected. I’m calling to request a squad of agents as back-up to make sure we make it out alive. Can you do that for me?\nM.E.G. Operative: … Copy that, three agents are on standby, I just need to know where the entrance to “Ghoul Town” is.\nStanley: It’s on Level 4, a door suspended around thirty centimeters off the ground; right around the corner of office block D98.\nM.E.G. Operative: … Copy that, we’re sending them your way as we speak.\nStanley: Thank you so much.\n[Stanley turns off the radio and packs it away]\nArthur: Great, so when’s the funeral? Tch. Why in the fuck did we think running around a desert, with no plan in mind, was a good idea?\nStanley: Listen Art, I have quite literally known you for my entire life. Get your shit together, we’re getting out of this alive or i’m going to kill you myself.\nArthur: I- I…. Stan I-\nArthur:…\nArthur: I- I don’t know what to say to that… sorry Stan, I lost myself for a second there.\nStanley: Sigh It’s fine man, what are friends for? Even I’m feeling a little looney.\nStanley: I’m just glad you’ve come back to your senses, even if it’s just a little bit.\nArthur: Sigh, But like-\nArthur: I’m so fucking tired. Why did we- Hold- Hold on… Stan! Stan look! Holy shit we made it!\nStanley: No way, no way- Dude you’re fucking with me aren’t you?\nArthur: Stan. Why would I torture myself and you and this way. Look!\nStanley: Holy shit. Holy shit. IT’S ACTUALLY REAL!\nArthur: YEAH IT IS! Phew. Just be cautious okay? I don’t want your ass getting killed after getting this far.\nStanley: Hah, same goes for you Aardvark boy.\nend log.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunities (Updated):\nGhoul Town:\nRoughly twelve kilometers in.The whole town looks like it covers around four thousand squre meters? The first thing that’s noticeable is the giant wood sign; sporting a nice greeting.\n“WELCOME TO GHOUL TOWN”\nWe were cautious at first, but as we walked, we noticed that the “Ghouls” were more human like than zombie/ghoulish. They resembled the undead, but seemed passive enough to try and communicate with, so we tried asking one of them about a place we could stay. They apparently can’t talk, but they did know sign language. Stanley’s ASL classes are finally paying off I see. And told us that if we we’re new to town, we should go to the local grocery store for a complementary gift basket! Wow, I’d never expect a place called Ghoul Town be so hospitable. And other people have been here too, that was really unexpected, considering your first reaction to a massive expanse of orange sand; wouldn’t be to go and explore it. Unless you’re us of course.\nThe grocery store is a lot like the ones from the Frontrooms, it’s even got running electricity and fresh produce too! We went up to the main counter near the back of the store and the manager, who’s name is Brenda- started signing up a storm with Stanley. Jesus, I can’t remember if Stanley took ASL lessons or signed up for the Naruto club. After a bit of back and forth Naruto hand signs, Brenda opened a door into what I assume is a pantry and comes out with two neatly tied up gift baskets. Now I warned Stan that the shouldn’t immediately trust these people sinc- Holy shit is that chocolate cake?\nSo, we’re alive, so that means the food wasn’t poisoned. Who knew ghouls ate the same stuff as humans instead of humans? After stuffing our faces full of pastries and bread rolls, Stanley started asking around if there was maybe a motel or something we could stay in for a while to rest. Until we ran into an ghoul who’s name was Neil, who I assume is an old man, since he brandished this polished spruce cane, slicked back white hair, bowl hat, and scoliosis. He signed to us, to head to the “Down Town” and to talk to the people living on the hill, we would’ve gotten more information out of him, but he fell asleep halfway through the sentence. Stanley said he actually could’ve said anything else, the signs he had made were so crude and lazy he barely got that. But, abiding by the logic of wise old people, and against our better judgement, we decided to go to the Down Town.\nPopulation:\n50+\nUniversal Ghoul Language:\n- Hand Writing\n- American Sign Language\n- Grunts\n- Hand Gestures\nThe Down Town:\nAfter following the directions of some more ghouls, we found a massive sign with,\n“DOWN TOWN THIS WAY!!”\nwritten in big red letters. So with this amazing information in hand, we hauled our nauseous half asleep asses over to the house on top of the hill, though it’s more of a sand dune. Luckily there was a cobblestone path that lead us to the house, Stanley is starting to feel really sick though, so I hope that these ghouls have some pencil and paper. And also that the food we received earlier wasn’t poisoned. My eyes are getting relentlessly itchy as well as the aforementioned nausea getting a bit worse. Thank god that the Down Town was barely ten minutes away from the main part of Ghoul Town, I don’t think Stan could’ve gone another twelve kilometers. Though, It was my turn to ask, so while Stanley sat down on the porch and took deep breaths; I took my own deep breath and rung the door bell.\n\nRecordedLog4\n\nHideLog\n\n\nRecorded Log 4\n\nstart log.\n…\nArthur: Hello?..\n???: Hm? Oh we have some visitors Fred!\nFred: Visitors? Is it Debra again, because I keep telling her we don’t need another water filter. It doesn’t matter if water tastes slightly different, they can’t even taste anything!\n???: Naaaa\nFred: Sigh Bob can you just tell me instead of grunting.\nBob: Oh- Alright fine.\n[The slight sound of rustling and footsteps can be heard and an eye can be seen through the mail slot in the door]\nBob: Hmm? Oh hey! Fred we got humans here!\nArthur: Um woah, I was not expecting you to.\nBob: Huh? Oh yeah, it must be strange seeing a talking ghoul here right? Considering nobody else can.\nArthur: Yeah, though they were really nice to us.\nFred: Oh hey there- don’t mind Bob he’s… uh kind of childish I guess.\nArthur: Haha, yeah I guess.\nFred: Oh. Are those gas masks?\nBob: Oh yeah! You’d usually need oxygen tanks. You guys can probably only stay another hour or two before your symptoms worsen to the point where they can’t heal!\nArthur: I um… WHAT?\nStanley: Ugh, please don’t shout man, I feel so… ughhh…\nArthur: Fuck man, you ran two kilometers earlier, your air filters must’ve been shredded a long time ago.\nBob: Breathe through your nose, it helps filter out at least some of the rust from entering and destroying your lungs.\nFred: Wait a moment, we don’t get human visitors too often, but we got oxygen tanks just in case they do come around. I’ll go and get them right now, make sure your friend sits up as straight as he can.\n[Fred sprints back into the house]\nArthur: Oh thank god- fuck. His oxygen filters are completely destroyed. Stanley don’t you dare die on me now.\n[Fred quickly sprints back onto the porch with two oxygen tanks in the pits of his arms]\nFred: I’m back, here take this and one for your friend as well.\nArthur: Oh thank god- I cannot thank you two enough.\nBob: Hey no problem man, considering you’ve lasted a lot longer than everyone else that’s reached the downtown. The rest I dunno about, they tried takin a return trip but they never visit.\nArthur: Mmmm well that gives me a lot to look forward to.\nBob: Hey no problem man.\nArthur: I- Fred how do can you stand living with this guy.\nFred: Well for one, I don’t. Two, we’re the mayors of this town. Three, he’s literally the only other ghoul I can talk without having to wave my hands around or waste pencil and paper.\nArthur: You two are the mayors? I understand you, but Bob? Well he’s the only other person who can talk, but still.\nBob: Alright, alright, enough of me, can you tell me why you’re here? I see you’re from that little M.E.G. group.\nArthur: Well, if you know who the M.E.G. are, then I’ll keep this short, I’m here with Stanley to record an article about your town.\nFred: Hmmm, we’ll if that’s the case, why don’t we take over the rest of this mission? Could you call up your higher ups and tell them that the Mayors of Ghoul Town will help them write this article?\nArthur: I-I dunno man… I mean I just met you guys… and I don’t… you know what, fuck it. Here, take this tablet, it’s a communication device that connects directly into the M.E.G. communication database. When you finish up the rest of the article, direct message me the final product.\nBob: Question.\nArthur: Ask your rotting heart out.\nBob: It works just like a normal tablet right?\nArthur: If you’re talking about internet videos we found an app that has archived every Youtube video in existence and is kept up to date.\nBob: Alright! Then it’s decided, you and your buddy Holes are gonna go back and we’ll record the rest of the article for you!\nStanley: Alright… I think I’m good. I feel a bit better, you ready to head back yet?\nArthur: Yeah we should be going, thanks for everything guys.\nFred: Yeah, those oxygen tanks aren’t going to last anymore back and forth babble, we’ll take care of this for you, just make sure to visit sometime if you.\n\nend log.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Atmosphere\nThe atmosphere in Level 99 contains about 30% rust, making it extremely dangerous for anyone who does not have an oxygen tank. The rust contained within the skies and sand are what give it it’s signature look. A lot of humans have made it to Ghoul Town, but none of them have managed to survive the return trip. Hopefully, Stanley and Arthur will be the first ones to make it out alive.\nGhouls:\nThe ghouls in Level 99 are very passive, and won’t become aggravated without a reason. Just like anyone else, they don’t like annoying people, or narcissists. They can’t speak, but they understand english and try to communicate the best they can with body language, hand coordination, or some of them out right know American Sign Language. Though the universal language in Ghoul Town is comprised solely of grunts, since that seems to be the only thing they can annunciate. The only exception to this is of course Bob and I; we seem to be the only ones capable of speech.\nEntrances and Exits:\nEntrances:\nOn Level 4, there is a door suspended roughly 30 centimeters off the ground, with a sign hung on it that says, “Ghoul Town”, in big red letters.\nOn Level 11, there is a random trapdoor floating two meters off the ground. When you open the trapdoor, a ladder will fall out which you can use to climb through into Level 99.\nExits:\nTo exit the level, you have to come back through the same door, or discover a different door which leads to other levels.\nThere is a door roughly two kilometers northwest of Ghoul Town labeled “Swimming Pool” which leads to Level 7, though this is not a viable exit since the door places you underwater when you enter. Turning you into fish food.\nThere is another door five kilometers to the east of Ghoul town labeled “Arcade!!!” Which leads into Level 389. This door with open into a small walk in closet that leads into the main part of Level 389.\n\n\nAuthor(s)\n\nHide author\n\nSoyShamoy\nThe image was made by me in Sketchbook Autodesk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n« Level 98 | Level 99 | Level 100 »\n\n\n\n                    "}
