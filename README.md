# backrooms-api

An API for fetching data from the backrooms Wikidot in an organised way.

## Why

I made this because I couldn't find it anywhere else so I decided to make my own
The code rn is dog shit with urine and vinegar combined. Vegetable medely.

## Is this legal?

PFFT-
I have don't have the slightest, planck-length miniscule atom of an idea of whether this is legal or not. Honestly, I wouldn't be suprised if this repo gets striked within a couple days.

\* Ahem \* this tool is purely educational and should only be used for educational purposes..

## ROADMAP
- [x] Parsing title of backrooms level
- [x] Parsing description of backrooms level (kinda). It doesn't work too well, and I haven't revisited that piece of code in a while. Gonna be a shitstorm
- [x] Parsing images of backrooms level
- [x] Parsing entrances and exits of backrooms level. This took so fucking long, that if I had to recreate it, I would kill myself.
- [ ] Parsing communities & outposts of level
- [ ] Parsing class of level
- [ ] Parsing entities of level

I think that's it... This is gonna hurt like a [############]
